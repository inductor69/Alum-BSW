                           <h2>When is the best time to start preparing for the Placement season? What are the steps to get started with it?
                           </h2>
                           I was targeting consulting. It was my first preference. So, I will be speaking in this context only. Broadly, in summers you need to start coding or quant prep then in July or August, start case prep. Before placement sem, aim to develop some business acumen. You can do this by reading newspapers & watching some youtube videos that discuss about businesses and are also a fun watch (eg: Wall Street Journal, CNBC). Developing good mental math skills is very helpful - if you can make sense out of numbers quickly-it really gives you the extra stars. These are some things you can work on individually. For case prep, you need to practice with other people.                    
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <h2>What is the best way to go about practicing cases?

                              </h2>
                              Firstly, you can talk to seniors and understand the basics of what cases are and case prep is like, take pointers on how you need to plan your process. Watching Victor Cheng videos and reading the standard resources like CIC, Day1, etc. is a good starting point and helps build a starting framework. When it comes to practicing cases, start with your own circle. You struggle at the beginning but as you practice more, you will improve. You should move on to seniors for case practice only when you have done some work on your own. It is like you should have something that they can shape otherwise they will be shaping thin air! Slowly your thinking gets polished and you carve out your own way of solving problems which aligns with your thought process.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                               <h2>You talk about reading the standard case prep books and watching victor cheng videos, when did you start on these? How much time should one give to learning from these resources?

                              </h2>
                              I did them only in my 7th sem. They are not very time-consuming. Spend max 2-3 days to read books and victor cheng videos totaled are not more than 6 hours. So, it is not really needed to start very early. What I did start early was watching short videos on these channels which had short business success and failure stories. It helped me get ideas on what kind of practices businesses actually undertake in real life.
 
                              Conclusion: At an individual level, work on your business aptitude & mental math skills, read some standard books and watch Victor Cheng videos. For case practice, start with your own circle and then reach out to seniors.

                               <h2>A good CV is very important for a consulting shortlist. What are your key observations in this context from seeing people around you and what is your advice to us here?

                              </h2>
                              Breaking myth
                              Myth: Eca, Por, Intern se consult mein naukri lagti hai
                              Reality: CG is the most important thing on your CV, it is the first thing which anyone sees on your cv
                               
                              Building your CV is a process that extends over all 3 of your years before placements and hence it is important to keep track of what you have in your bag at every point. I have been conscious of what might get me a CV point all throughout, this isn't to suggest that this is the lens you should take for viewing your college activities but being aware of what you have objectively helps you comfortably take time for activities that you love doing with nothing but your own satisfaction to gain.
                               
                              Analogy & Advice - Your CV is like making a dish, you check the salt before adding more Hence its important to constantly monitor what your dish has and what it needs more. You can spend time on it actively or even take help from seniors who can give you feedback on improving your cv while you have the time
                               
                              Bottomline is - Never underestimate the power of a good cgpa. Don’t leave out things you are interested in just because you can’t add them to your cv. But, at the same time be aware of what you have and where you lack. Attempt to strike a balance. There is no one single magic formula, you gotta work this out for yourself.
                               
                              One thing I will say about the intern section in your CV - internships are very important, having at least 2 internships is good, moreover a consulting intern definitely acts as a plus point.
                              
                              
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                 <h2>What were the major differences between your intern and placement season?

   
                                 </h2>
                                 The metrics to judge a candidate are very different. Internship process is not extensive, especially for consulting. Firstly, there are very few firms (only Strategy& and Nomura in my time). The evaluation is not continuous and the only interaction with the company is on the interview day hence there is always an element of luck that is stronger here.
                                 Placements are more structured, there is continuous evaluation through the buddy program. For placements companies spend more time to understand your competence, it’s okay if you make some mistakes in the process, what the companies are looking for is someone who can learn fast & show improvement.
                                 
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    <h2>What was the major source of stress for you during your preparations? How did you deal with it?

   
      
                                    </h2>
                                    I was confident I would get a shortlist at most firms I applied to so I didn't prepare a lot for any backup. I won’t recommend that as there is a lot of uncertainty around consulting and it acted as a source of stress for me. Having a backup helps keep your mind calm. But the thing is stress is not good for performance anywhere, in consulting or elsewhere. In fact, a major thing I was working on during placements is to not get stressed. In the consulting field, they want people who have clarity and are confident about themselves. I understood I can’t crack this as long as I am stressed.
                                    
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                       <h2>You say an important thing you worked on, in the past 4-5 months, was to prevent yourself from getting stressed. Can you share any techniques that you used or how did you go about this?
   
      
         
                                       </h2>
                                       Once I knew about my shortlists (I had 4 on day 1) - I calmed my mind saying I will surely convert at least one. Furthermore, I managed stress by talking to people, writing my options down & evaluating the odds etc to get a hold of where I stand from a detached standpoint. I would get objective clarity on what I needed to focus on next and I'd shift my mind towards that process. It helps you improve and consequently reduces stress. It’s like a cycle. It is up to you whether you want it to be a vicious cycle or a virtuous one. (eg: after a case, feedback I got was that “everything’s fine but when it comes to any calculation, you freak out like you have seen a ghost.” - I dropped out of the call really bothered and upset. I messaged all seniors & pretty much everyone said practice and you’ll improve. Then I resolutely decided I will work to improve my maths skills and every day I spent 30 mins to 1 hr on this. Slowly, I started to gain confidence.)
 
                                       Stress kis cheez se hota hai? When you identify a problem and you feel like its a very big problem and get overwhelmed by it. The outlook one should try to adopt, something which really works for me, is that 'Hey, I am happy to have identified a problem, I can work on it and fix it'. I am glad I got to know about my poor mental math skills during mock case practices and hence, I was able to work on them.
                                       
                                        </p>

                                          <h2>How was your placement experience like, as in the day you had interviews? Would you have preferred offline interviews?

      
         
            
                                          </h2>
                                          It was a pretty short experience and I would say smooth as well. My first preference was BCG. I had 2 interviews 30 min each and I was pretty much done
 
                                          I feel the online mode worked out well for me, I was less stressed as the interviewer was not right next to me. The offline mode also limits your access physically since you need to move around a lot from one floor to another, which might have stressed me out. So, I think I prefer online over offline but this is just my hindsight speaking which shouldn't be a reliable voice.

Did you face any issues here? Could you tell how to work on honing this skill?

   
         
            
               
                                             </h2>
                                             Two things became really important in online interviews. First, silences felt a lot more pronounced and awkward since the interviewer couldn't see your sheet while you write down your thoughts. Second, clarity of thought and communicating the same is important for proving your understanding. So, you can develop these skills during the process of your case practices & mock interviews.

                                                   In my 2nd year summers, I did a foreign research internship in Taiwan. I was keeping research as a pursuable option, but eventually decided to let go of it. I found the work very individual based and it didn’t gel with my personality - I am someone who likes talking to people and trying out new things. So, research didn't feel like my cup of tea and I wanted to do something else. I was conscious of what I have in my CV and consulting was something I could get into. So, I prepared to get a consulting intern. Got selected in Nomura. It was a remote intern but found the work to be something I might enjoy doing, hence I decided to go for a consulting role in placements.
                                                   
                                                   
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                      <h2> 	If someone does not get an intern via OCS in their 3rd year, what should they do? How does it affect their placement chances?

                                                      You definitely shouldn’t get disheartened. Intern process is short and sometimes random. However, this doesn’t mean you should only consider it as a lack of luck. What you should do is introspect. I couldn’t make it to Strategy& which was my 1st pref during my internship process and later I reflected on what went wrong and what I needed to improve from a placement perspective.
 
                                                      As far as placement chances are concerned, I know people who didn’t get placed in the entire phase 1 of the internship process, but they worked dedicatedly on impactful projects at their workplace and/or had they had other things on their CV and got into the top firms. For consulting, not having a TnP intern will only affect one's chances in the internship section. Consulting companies look for 3 spikes and you can find your centre nevertheless. My advice would be to get an intern and try to learn as much as you can sincerely, you can create a major impact with the way you write about your internship experience on your CV.
